A BBcode parser designed to be used with Ruby on Rails
======================================================
A bbcode parser gem you can include in your rails app to parse bbcode-formatted
strings to HTML or any other format you like.

The bbcode gem consists of 4 parts:

- The `Tokenizer`-class, which converts the bbcode-formatted string to a stream
  of tokens.
- The `Parser`-class, which attempts to pair bbcode tags to bbcode elements.
- The `Handler`-class, which converts bbcode elements anyway you like.
- The `Helpers`-module, which adds a method to String, allowing you to convert
  bbcode-formatted strings with a registered handler.

Additionally, a `HtmlHandler` class is available. This class is a Handler
designed to convert bbcode elements to HTML more easily.

Installation:
-------------
Add the gem to the gemfile of your project:
`gem "th-bbcode", "~> 0.4.0"`

Usage:
------
Create and register a handler. In this example, I'm creating a HtmlHandler and
I'm going to register it as `:html`.

```ruby
require 'rubygems'
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'bbcode'

Bbcode::Base.register_handler :html, Bbcode::HtmlHandler.new(
  :b => :strong,
  :i => :em,
  :url => [ :a, { :href => "%{0}" } ],
  :txt => ->(element){ "#{element.content.source}" },
  :img => ->(element){ %(<img src="#{CGI.escapeHTML(element.content.source)}">) },
  :admin => ->(element, locals){ locals[:is_admin] ? element.content : "" },
  :color => [ :span, { :style => "color: %{0};" } ]
)
```

That's it! You can now parse any string as bbcode and convert it to html with
the `:html`-handler like this:

```ruby
"[b]Hello, bold world![/]".as_bbcode.to :html
# => <strong>Hello, bold world!</strong>
"[admin]Hello, admin![/]".as_bbcode.to :html, :is_admin => true
# => Hello, admin!
"[admin]Hello, admin![/]".as_bbcode.to :html, :is_admin => false
# => 
```

If you're using this gem in a rails project, I would recommend registering your
handlers in an initializer.

See examples in `spec/` folder for detailed examples of usage.

Features:
---------
* Parsing regular bbcode tags like `[b]` and `[/b]`.
* Parsing anonymous closing bbcode tags like `[/]`.
* Parsing bbcode tags with arguments like `[a=foo, bar]`, `[a foo=1 bar:2]`,
  `[a=foo, bar bar:1 foo=2]` and `[a="foo" b='bar']`.
* Parsing nested bbcode elements like `[b]bold[i]and italic[/]only bold[/]`,
  which might result to `<b>bold<i>and italic</i>only bold</b>`.
* Parsing incorrectly nested bbcode elements like `[b]bold[i]and italic[/b]only
  italic[/]`, which might result to `<b>bold<i>and italic</i></b><i>only
  italic</i>`.
* Passing variables to the handler and accessing them to the element handler
  callbacks.

Using WillScanString:
---------------------
You might want to convert URLs in the message to be converted to a hyperlink,
or you might want smileys in your bbcode message. This can be done by
defining a `:"#text"`-handler in your Handler or HtmlHandler.

I personally used WillScanString's StringScanner class to achieve this:

```ruby
# Requires the will_scan_string gem
require "will_scan_string"

string_scanner = WillScanString::StringScanner.new
string_scanner.register_replacement "<", "&lt;"
string_scanner.register_replacement ">", "&gt;"
string_scanner.register_replacement "&", "&amp;"
string_scanner.register_replacement "\"", "&quot;"
string_scanner.register_replacement /(?:\r\n|\r|\n)/, "<br>"
string_scanner.register_replacement /[^\s@]+@[^\s@]/, ->(email){ %(<a href="mailto:#{CGI.escapeHTML(email)}">#{CGI.escapeHTML(email)}</a>) }

# +handler+ is your Bbcode::HtmlHandler or Bbcode::Handler instance
handler.register_element_handler :"#text", ->(text){ string_scanner.replace(text) }
```

The above example converts newlines to `<br>`-tags, escapes HTML entities
and converts e-mail addresses to clickable mailto hyperlinks.

Note: By overwriting the `:"#text"`-handler in the HtmlHandler, html entities
are no longer replaced automatically: You need to escape them in your handler
callback yourself. Failing to do so might expose your website to XSS
vulnerabilities.

Using another parser or tokenizer:
----------------------------------
Although this bbcode parser gem was primary designed for converting bbcode to
HTML, it is possible to use another parser or tokenizer while still using the
same handlers.

Using another tokenizer allows you to parse anything as if it were to be
bbcode. This feature is still in development, but a nice example is my own
ycode gem. This gem can be found here:
`https://github.com/tobyhinloopen/y-code`

Todo:
-----
* An easier way to handle text around bbcode tags to, for example, add smileys
  and wrap hyperlinks to URLs. Currently, the only way to achieve this is by
  adding a `:"#text"`-handler to your handler and adding the functionality
  yourself. (note: See the above note regarding WillScanString)
* An easier way to include the content, source or content-source in the
  `HtmlHandler`-class.
* Review handleability of element interrupts.
* Review regular expression matching bbcode tags to allow tags having names
  containing characters other than `A-Z`, `0-9`, `_` and `-`, possibly based on
  the current registered tags.
* Add CDATA-like feature for bbcode tags to allow tags to be ignored within
  certain elements. Useful for `[code]`-tags.
* Add a default handler with the most common bbcode tags.
